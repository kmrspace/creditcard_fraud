Fraudulent activities percolate across industries and business lines, and affect almost every enterprise and individual. Such activities could be described as business transactions that are perpetrated by malicious entities that appear genuine.


 
A 2019 report by the University of Portsmouth estimates that globally, the losses caused due to frauds equate to roughly 6% of the entire world’s GDP, or around $5.127 trillion. An enterprise could face around 3–6% of losses due to fraud, with the highest losses amounting to 10% of the revenue.
 

Enterprises are being severely affected by fraudsters. Losses owing to fraud have increased from an average of 4.57% in the global recession phase of 2007–2008 to 7.15% in 2017–2018. This is a staggering growth of 56.5% in a period of 10 years.

 
The report summarises how existing individuals and businesses are more susceptible to fraud than their predecessors due to:

Increasing preference of individuals towards unconventional modes of payment, with lesser adherence to common standards;

Greater complexity of processes and systems, which makes it easier for fraudsters to escape the process without any trace;

Increase in digital transactions, with less in-person interaction, making it difficult for victims to identify fraudsters; and

Rapid change in businesses, with necessary safety and control protocol struggling to catch up

Each of these factors gives you hints regarding what enterprises can do to reduce the frequency and severity of fraudulent activities. In this session, you will learn how enterprises aim to detect fraudulent transactions, with a special focus on fraudulent credit card transactions.
